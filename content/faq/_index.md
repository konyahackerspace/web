### What is a hacker?

A **[hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker)** is someone who is very good with technology and solves problems in clever or unusual ways.

The word hacker here doesn’t mean a security expert or someone doing illegal computer activities.

### What is hacker culture?

**[Hacker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture)** is a community of people who enjoy creatively exploring and pushing the limits of technology. It's about solving problems in clever ways, learning by doing, and sharing knowledge.
This culture also overlaps with **[maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture)** — a modern DIY movement focused on building, fixing, and inventing things using tech and tools. Makers often work on electronics, robotics, 3D printing, and crafts, all while embracing the same spirit of creativity and collaboration.

It’s currently managed by the co-founders, who guide the community’s vision and operations. Others may join in the future as needed.

We are not affiliated with any organization, religious group, or political party—and we have no interest in forming such connections.

### What do you do in the hackerspace?

We explore all kinds of tech topics—like software development, hobby electronics, 3D printing, robotics, HAM radio, AI, and more!

There’s no fixed plan. We bring together curious, tech-savvy people, provide tools, and let collaboration grow naturally.

You’re free to work on anything that fits the spirit of the space and stays within halal boundaries.

Check out our past activities to see what’s been done.

### Do you have a physical space?

Not yet but it's a near-term goal. Once there’s enough demand, we’ll begin building one, inshaallah.

Once we have a physical space, we plan to introduce paid memberships.

Members are free to leave at any time.

The management also has the right to end someone’s membership if they violate the community rules or go against our core values.

---

### What are the community rules?

Our goal is to maintain a respectful, peaceful, and productive environment for all our members.

We’re guided by this verse from the Qur’an (5:2):

> ...cooperate with one another in righteousness and piety, and do not cooperate in sin and aggression...

With that in mind, we ask all members to:

- Keep things halal
- Be kind and respectful to others
- Avoid religious or political arguments
- And lastly — **have fun and build awesome things**!
