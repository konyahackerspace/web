A hacker is someone who is very good with technology and solves problems in clever or unusual ways.
The word hacker here doesn’t mean a security expert or someone doing illegal computer activities.
What is hacker culture? Hacker culture is a community of people who enjoy creatively exploring and pushing the limits of technology. It&rsquo;s about solving problems in clever ways, learning by doing, and sharing knowledge. This culture also overlaps with maker culture — a modern DIY movement focused on building, fixing, and inventing things using tech and tools. Makers often work on electronics, robotics, 3D printing, and crafts, all while embracing the same spirit of creativity and collaboration.
